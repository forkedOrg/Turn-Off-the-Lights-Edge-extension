Thanks for checking out Turn Off the Lights Microsoft Edge Extension!
PREVIEW Turn Off the Lights v3.2.0.10

Instructions:
	1. Open Microsoft Edge
	2. Click the "..." button and then select "Extensions"
	3. Click the "Load unpacked extension" button
	4. Using the folder picker, browse and then select the "Turn Off the Lights Edge Extension" folder
	5. Click the "Select folder" button

HOW IT WORKS?
When the installation is complete, you see a Welcome page. And the Welcome Guide (with sample HTML5 video player to test the lights on/off).
If you go now to www.youtube.com/c/turnoffthelights you see the gray lamp button in the address bar.
With one single click it dims the page and highlight automatically the video player.

KNOW ISSUES
+ There is no "Options" button visible in the Edge extension sidebar.
+ Few features is disabled in the Edge extension, such as the "Camera Motion" and "Speech" (later the Cortana).
+ Can't load the extension -> permission issue. Run the cmd script again.
+ No support for Chrome Storage Sync -> use the Chrome Storage Local
